# Discord Image Source (Desktop)

### Currently in-progress / 95% Completion

## Summary
This is a bot code that gives user the power to post random image by typing "/image" (without the quote) in the chat.
The idea of this code is based on the famous Discord Meme Bot that takes memes from the internet and post it.

This project utilizes the low level and open source development framework called LibGDX. 
The framework gives the project many higher level tools to efficiently create the game without re-inventing the wheel while 
having full access to the low level API in case you need to look at the code source.
