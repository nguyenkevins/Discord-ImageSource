# Discord Image Source (Desktop)

### Currently in-progress / 95% Completion

## Summary
This is a bot code that gives user the power to post random image by typing "/image" (without the quote) in the chat.
The idea of this code is based on the famous Discord Meme Bot that takes memes from the internet and post it.

This project utilizes the Java wrapper called "Java Discord API", which provides a clean and full wrapping of the Discord API
and Websocket Events. The library allows the coder to create useful tool that provides functionality and usefulness to Discord bots.
